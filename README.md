# Pacmen

    <p>This assignment was about creating a PacMan at the click of a button in a random spot on the screen. Every time you click this button then a new PacMan would appear in a different random spot. If you clicked the start game button then all of the pacmen you create on your screen would start boucing around on the screen. If they hit an edge they would bounce in a different direction. </p>
